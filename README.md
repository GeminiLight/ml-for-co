## Introduction

This is a brief survey on machine learning for combinatorial optimization, a fascinating and significant topic. We mainly collect relevant papers from top conferences, classify them into several categories by method types, and indicate additional information.

It's inevitable to have omissions or errors during the discussion for the limitation of the author's knowledge. Welcome to feedback them you found.
